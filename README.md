# GymStrengthBuddy
School assignment that we did for our Android project.

The app itself was designed to help people who are starting weight lifting and don't know too much about the subject.

The calculations for the weights are done by following Jim Wendlers 5/3/1 program (https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/531-how-to-build-pure-strength, https://www.jimwendler.com/)

Simple idea:

Set up your max weights on 4 main areas, the program will calculate sets for you and give you ideas for supportive exercises for each day.
